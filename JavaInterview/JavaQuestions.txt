2.  which of the following will directly stop the execution of a Thread? 
    Answer : wait()
3.    class Test 
      {  
          private Demo d; 
          void start() 
          {  
              d = new Demo(); 
              this.takeDemo(d); /* Line 7 */
          } /* Line 8 */
          void takeDemo(Demo demo) 
          { 
              demo = null;  
              demo = new Demo(); 
          } 
      }
      When is the Demo object eligible for garbage collection?
      A.	After line 7
      B.	After line 8
      C.	After the start() method completes
      D.	When the instance running this code is made eligible for garbage collection.
      Answer: Option D

      Explanation:

      Option D is correct. By a process of elimination.

      Option A is wrong. The variable d is a member of the Test class and is never directly set to null.

      Option B is wrong. A copy of the variable d is set to null and not the actual variable d.

      Option C is wrong. The variable d exists outside the start() method (it is a class member). So, when the start() method finishes the variable d still holds a       reference.
